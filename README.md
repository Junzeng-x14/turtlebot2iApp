This is the source code of EECS206A project. See more description of our project in the project website [(link)](http://turtlebot2i.weebly.com).

We implemented color sorting and identification plus markers fetching and manipulation on the turtlebot 2i. The framework of this code is mainly from [Interbotix official repository](https://github.com/Interbotix/turtlebot2i).
